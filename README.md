## Prediction Assignment Writeup

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular 
activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, 
your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and
dumbell of 6 participants.

## Project Goal

The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the
exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of
the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how
you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected
out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use
your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
